			VariCW SPECIFICATION


- Has four operating modes
	1. Basic mode has no correction but flags the user if errors are
	   detected.

	2. Manual correction mode flags the user if errors are detected
	   and allows the user to request retransmission of the message. 

	3. Auto mode automatically request retransmission when an error
	   is detected.

	4. "Last ditch" mode can be invoked after a poor link quality
	   message is displayed in manual and retransmission requests 
	   will continue until 1 element time has exceeded 1 second.

	5. The user can change modes after the end of each transmission.



- Uses modified DFCW (Dual Frequency CW)
	1. Center frequency, i.e. carrier, is on for 1 element time 
	   between characters.

	2. Dots are shifted 25 hertz below the carrier and remain on 
	   til all dots have been sent.

	3. Dashes are shifted 25 hertz above the carrier and remain on
	   til all dashes have been sent.

	4. International Morse Code will be used to encode characters.

	5. Element time varies with link quality. The poorer the link,
	   indicated by mismatched CRC's, the longer each element is
	   transmitted.

	6. After a retransmission requests has been made a "poor link
	   quality" message will be displayed. 

	7. In manual mode the user can continue to retry or discontinue
	   the contact. In automatic mode the retries will continue
	   until contact is re-established or the 1 element time has
	   exceeded 1 second.



- Each message has header and footer made up of CRC sum
	1. A sum of CRC's for the message is sent at the beginning, header
	   and end, footer, of each message for link quality calculations.

	2. EAx is used to seed with the first character of the
	   message. The resulting number is then used as seed for the
	   next character so on and so on each succeeding character
	   until either the end of the message or EOT is set.

	3. A message will contain 255 characters, not including header and 
	   footer, or less depending on when EOT is set.


	4. CRC will be 8 bits to assure that there will not be two 
	   different messages with the same CRC.



- Speed varies based on link quality calculation
	1. When a message is completely received the message CRC and 
	   calculated CRC are compaired. If CRC's are the same the 
	   message is sent to stdout. If an error is detected
	   (CRC's don't match), it is handled according to the current
	   operating mode.

	2. If retransmission is requested, the character transmission
	   speed is reduced 10% from the previous transmission and the 
	   message is resent. This means that the transmission speed 
	   for each message must be saved at both the transmitting end 
	   and the receiving end. 

	3. In automode if three messages are sent without out error the
	   transmission speed is increased by 5% for each new message 
	   until errors are detected. The transmission speed will then 
	   be reduced by 10% and the transmission speed will remain the
	   same for the next 10 messages before an attempt to increase
	   the transmission speed will begin again. If errors are 
	   detected during the 10 message count retransmission is 
	   requested and the 10 message count is reset to 0.

	4. Retransmission requests are suspended after 10 retries and a
	   poor link quality message is sent to stdout. "Last ditch"
	   mode may be invoked at this time.

	5. The first transmission in a QSO will begin at a speed 
	   approximately equivalent to 50 wpm. Transmission speed will
	   then increase or decrease based on error detection.



- Frame definition 
	|BOT: 2 second carrier followed by characters '-...--'
	| begin message	'-...--' 
	| CRC sum 
	| message body (max 255) 
	| end of message '--...-'
		.
		.
		.
	| begin message'-...--' 
	| CRC sum 
	| message body (max 255) 
	| end of message '--...-'
		.
		.
		.
	(continue until EOT flag is set)
		.
		.
		.
	| begin nth message'-...--' 
	| CRC sum 
	| message body (max 255) 
	| end of message '--...-'
	| EOT: characters 'eot' followed by 2 second carrier

	NOTE: If EOT flag happens to be set and there are no more
		characters to be transmitted place three spaces in the
		message area to create a last message.



- Retransmission protocol 
	1. Receiving station sends |BOT|AF|CRC|etetetet|AE|EOT| with
	   speed 10% slower then the speed of the transmission just 
	   received with errors. 

	2. Transmitting station will resend same message 10% slower 
	   then the previous transmission matching the resend request's
	   speed.

	3. If the resend request fails to be heard by the transmitting
	   station, another request is sent 10% slower then the 
	   previous resend request. This will continue until the 
	   transmission is resent or 10 resend requests have been sent.
	   A "Resend request failed. Link failure." message is sent to 
	   sdtout.



- Tone protocol
	1. A dot or a dash has the same element time (length).

	2. Multiple dots or dashes are determined by how long the tone
	   is shifted below or above the carrier. Example: For the
	   letter z, the tone would be shifted above the carrier for 2
	   element times then immediately shifted below the carrier for
	   2 element times then returned to the carrier frequency. 
	   NOTE: Letter z is dash dash dot dot.

	3. The z is followed by the carrier frequency for 1 element 
	   time. 

	5. The carrier tone will be 1200 Hz. A dot tone will be 1175 Hz
	   while a dash tone will be 1225 Hz.

	6. End of word character is .-.-..



- Incoming message protocol
	1. BOT detected.

	2. Beginning of message (BOM) is detected store the next 16
	   bits in the CRC register.

	3. Calculate CRC as message arrives and store the next n bits
	   of the massage until end of message (EOM) is detected.
 
	4. Compare transmitted CRC with calculated CRC and set CRC fail
	   flag as required.

	5. Repeat 2, 3, 4 until EOT is detected.

	6. Check failed CRC flag. In automatic mode if CRC fail is true
	   request retransmition. In other modes send message to stdout
	   and notify user of poor link quality. 

	7. In manual mode check for user retransmission request.



- Outgoing message protocol

	1. Outgoing message will not be transmitted until the number of
	   characters reaches 255 or the end of transmission flag is
	   detected.

	2. If end of transmission flag is detected and there are no
	   more characters in the out going character buffer 3 end of
	   word characters will be placed in the out going character
	   buffer and the buffer will be sent.
